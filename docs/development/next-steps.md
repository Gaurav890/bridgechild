# Next Steps - Helping Hands Sponsorship Platform

## What to Ask Claude Code For in Your Next Session

### ✅ COMPLETED: Core Entity Models & Profile Management System

### Immediate Priority: Frontend Development
**Start your next session with:**
> "Please implement the authentication UI components for the Helping Hands app. I need login, register, and email verification components using React and Tailwind CSS. The backend APIs are ready at /api/auth/*"

**Follow-up requests:**
1. **Role-Based Dashboards**: "Create dashboard components for all user roles (sponsor, child, ngo, admin)"
2. **Profile Forms**: "Build profile creation and editing forms for sponsors, NGOs, and children"
3. **Child Search Interface**: "Create the child search and matching interface for sponsors"

### Secondary Priority: Business Logic
4. **Matching Algorithm Foundation**: "Implement basic sponsor-child matching based on preferences and availability"
5. **Communication System**: "Create moderated messaging between sponsors and children through NGOs"
6. **Payment Integration**: "Set up Stripe integration for recurring sponsorship payments"

### ✅ COMPLETED: Backend Development
7. **Authentication System**: Complete with 13 API endpoints
8. **Profile Management**: Full CRUD for all user types with 13 API endpoints
9. **Database System**: 8 tables with proper relationships and migrations

### Testing & Quality Assurance
10. **Integration Tests**: "Create comprehensive tests for the new entity models and relationships"
11. **Security Audit**: "Review and test all security measures, especially for child data protection"
12. **Performance Testing**: "Test database performance with realistic data volumes"

### Production Readiness
13. **Environment Configuration**: "Set up production environment variables and deployment configuration"
14. **CI/CD Pipeline**: "Create GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment"
15. **Monitoring & Logging**: "Implement application monitoring and error tracking"

## Quick Reference Commands for Each Session

### Before Starting Development
```bash
# Verify containers are running
docker-compose ps

# Check backend logs
docker logs bridgechild-backend-1

# Test authentication is working
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"test2@example.com","password":"SecurePassword123@"}'

# Test profile creation (use token from login response)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/profiles/sponsor -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" -d '{"firstName":"Test","lastName":"Sponsor","country":"USA"}'
```

### Development Workflow
1. Always start by checking current container status
2. Update development-log.md after each session
3. Run tests after implementing new features
4. Update API documentation for new endpoints
5. Test authentication integration with new features

### Decision Points to Discuss
- **Child Age Verification**: How to handle age verification for children?
- **Payment Processing**: Which payment methods to support?
- **Communication Moderation**: Automated vs manual message screening?
- **Photo Sharing**: Safety protocols for child photos?
- **Multi-language**: Which languages to support initially?

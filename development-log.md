- [ ] Role-based dashboard components for all user types
- [ ] Profile creation and management forms
- [ ] Child search and matching interface for sponsors
- [ ] Document upload and verification interface

## Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express for rapid development and good ecosystem
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for ACID compliance and complex queries
- **Frontend**: React for component reusability and ecosystem
- **Authentication**: JWT for stateless authentication
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent development environment

### Key Challenges to Address
1. **Child Safety**: Ensuring all communications are properly moderated
2. **Document Verification**: Balancing automation with human oversight
3. **Matching Algorithm**: Creating fair and effective sponsor-child pairing
4. **Payment Security**: Handling financial transactions safely
5. **Scalability**: Designing for potential growth

### Learning Goals
- Advanced React patterns for complex state management
- PostgreSQL optimization for search and matching queries
- Stripe integration for recurring payments
- Docker multi-stage builds for production
- Security best practices for sensitive data

## Session 2 Summary - Authentication Foundation Complete

## Session 3 Summary - Complete Profile Management System

### What Was Accomplished
**Complete Core Entity Models & Profile Management System** (production-ready):
- **Database Models**: SponsorProfile, NGOProfile, ChildProfile, Document models with full CRUD
- **6 New Migrations**: All successfully executed (004-009) for profile tables
- **Profile APIs**: 13 new endpoints for complete profile management
- **Child Registration**: Both self-serve and NGO-assisted registration workflows
- **Document Management**: Secure file handling with verification system
- **Role-Based Security**: Comprehensive authorization for all profile operations

### Technical Achievements
- Implemented comprehensive child safety and privacy protection
- Created unique child identification system (CH-YYYY-XXXX codes)
- Built NGO verification workflow for organizational trust
- Added profile completeness tracking for all user types
- Implemented privacy-safe public/private profile views

### Database Verification
- 8 total tables now in PostgreSQL with proper relationships
- All migrations executed successfully in Docker environment
- Profile data persistence confirmed with UUID primary keys
- Comprehensive indexing for search performance

### API Testing Confirmed
✅ Sponsor profile creation and retrieval working
✅ Role-based authorization properly enforced
✅ Child profile privacy protection functioning
✅ NGO verification workflow operational

## Session 2 Summary - Authentication Foundation Complete

### What Was Accomplished
**Complete Authentication System** (production-ready foundation):
- **User Model**: Full CRUD operations with PostgreSQL integration, UUID primary keys
- **Security**: bcrypt password hashing, JWT access/refresh token system, account lockout protection
- **Email Verification**: Complete workflow with development-friendly logging
- **Role Management**: Multi-role system (sponsor, child, ngo, admin) with middleware
- **Database**: PostgreSQL migrations, indexes, and proper relationships
- **Docker Integration**: Backend containerized and connecting properly to PostgreSQL
- **API Endpoints**: Registration, login, logout, profile, email verification, password reset

### Technical Achievements
- Fixed UUID ES module compatibility issues
- Configured development email service (console logging)
- Successful PostgreSQL connection via Docker networking
- Complete database migration system
- JWT middleware with proper error handling
- Request logging and security middleware

### Tested & Working
✅ User registration with validation
✅ Email verification flow
✅ Login with JWT token generation
✅ Protected route access
✅ Data persistence in PostgreSQL
✅ Role-based access control ready

## Claude Code Interaction Tips
- Always provide specific context about what feature you're working on
- Reference the current file structure when asking for help
- Ask for complete implementations rather than snippets
- Request tests alongside feature implementation
- Update this log after each development session
